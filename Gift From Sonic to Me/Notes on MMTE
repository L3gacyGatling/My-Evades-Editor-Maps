Hello there player, who is reading this.

I'm Legacy Gatling, the one who wrote this.

This message is shorter than most of my creator notes, as it's a map that I didn't created at all.

I don't know who created this map at all, but...

I just want to put it in this file (it's about 300 kb as a json, 475 if yaml).

How I got this file:

    So, about 2 weeks before April Fools, while creating Tranquil Tundra, one of my maps, (my memory is a bit fuzzy...), I asked Sonic.exe, the creator of the Evades Region Editor, of something I don't remember.
    Which then, they messaged with a discord cdn of a download of a map called "Monumental Migration Troll Edition", which indeed, there's a trick in there.
    I suspected that this map is meant as a April Fools joke for the official Evades.io, so I want to keep it a secret.
    So which, Sonic deleted the entire conversation of this (which is why I can't remember the specific messages).

Aftermath:

    After this interation, I decided to keep this file secret, and only release it after April Fools.
    However, on April Fools of Evades.io, the devs, mainly Amasterclasher (creator), and Piger (balancer), had created Stellar Square Hard as the April Fools joke.
    Which, this map just make me puzzle on the purpose of this creation...
    Though, I kept my prmoise of releasing it after April Fools (well, 3 days after), and this map is available to everyone to play.
-----
Hope you have fun (or not) with this map!

    Legacy out.
