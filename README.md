For any develeopers and Jr developers of Evades.io that read this, feel free to use, add, and edit any of my maps, as long as you credit me...


In order to use any of my map files:

1: open the evades editor that's on the description of this resposit.

2: Depending on the file, you need to enable or disable the "Legacy Speed Units" setting.

    A file that has ".legacy" before ".json" will require the "Legacy Speed Units" setting on (It's on by default).

    A file that doesn't have that requires the "Legacy Speed Units" setting off.

3. Press the import button at the top left corner (the one that looks like a arrow going out of a bracket).

4. Now, you're ready to play! At the left of the editor screen, press the white box to start playing. Press it again to stop playtesting.

   (There's also settings for things like visual, gameplay, mouse control, etc. It's in the gear at the bottom right).


Tips when playtesting:

Press "E" to go back a area.

Press "T" to go forward a area.

If you want to know certain commands type "/help" in the chatbox (chatbox can be opened by pressing "V" on your keyboard)





Also, if you want to play any of the offical maps (and deleted maps) from Evades.io, you can press the small rectangle under the import button, and choose a region (Stellar Square Hard requires a secret).
