For any develeopers and Jr developers of Evades.io that read this, feel free to use, add, and edit any of my maps, as long as you credit me...


In order to use any of my map files:

1: Download the zip file that's in this repository, or use this link that goes to the Evades Sandbox: https://pifary-dev.github.io/ravel/ 

    

2: Depending on the file, you need to enable or disable the "Legacy Speed Units" setting.

    A file that has ".legacy" before ".json" will require the "Legacy Speed Units" setting on (It's on by default).

    A file that doesn't have that requires the "Legacy Speed Units" setting off.

3a. If using the Editor, press the import button at the top left corner (the one that looks like a arrow going out of a bracket), and choose the file you want to play.

3b. If using the Sandbox, press the "Choose File" button at the top left of the site, and choose the file you want to play.

4a. (If using the Editor) Now, you're ready to play! At the left of the editor screen, press the white box to start playing. Press it again to stop playtesting.

4b. (If using the Sandbox) Now, you're ready to play! You can press the green button to start playing. Please note that the Sandbox may not have certain enemies from Evades implemented into its application (which is indicted with enemies colored a dark purple, but not firing anything).

   (There's also settings for things like visual, gameplay, mouse control, etc. It's in the gear at the bottom right)
   
   (The settings for Sandbox is located at the left of the site, please note that you can't access those settings when you press play)


Tips when playtesting (in the Editor only):

Press "E" to go back a area.

Press "T" to go forward a area.

If you want to know certain commands type "/help" in the chatbox (chatbox can be opened by pressing "V" on your keyboard)
