In order to use any of my map files:

1: open the evades editor that's on the description of this resposit.

2: Depending on the file, you need to enable or disable the "Legacy Speed Units" setting.

    A file that has ".legacy" before ".json" will require the "Legacy Speed Units" setting on (It's on by default).

    A file that doesn't have that requires the "Legacy Speed Units" setting off.

3. Press the import button at the top left corner (the one that looks like a arrow going out of a bracket).

4. Now, you're ready to play! Go to settings, and press the "Playtesting" button to start playing.


Tips when playtesting:

Press "E" to go back a area.

Press "T" to go forrward a area.

Press "R" to set your level to 100, and upgrades all stats to max.

Press "N" to enable godmode. It also allows you to revive yourself when you got hit by an enemy.

If done playtesting, press the "Playtesting" button again.
