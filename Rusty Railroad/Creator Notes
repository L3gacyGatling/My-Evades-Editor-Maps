Welcome to the notes and extras for Rusty Railroad.

Created by L3gAcyGAtLing.

Note: This map has been updated, and so are these notes. If you want to compare the old to the new, there's a folder within the Rusty Railroad folder called "Classic Version", where you can play the older version of Rusty Railroad.

So, let's start with some talk, I guess (I don't have much of a story to tell):

    So... Have you ever been on a train before?
    Like not the monorail type of trains from Disney World, or those trains in amusement parks.
    Like a legit train with rails, train carts, and long destinations, and windows seeing the urban cities, or the beauty of nature.
    Those trains.
    I've never went on a train like those in my life.
    Though I think of them as a way to look out and find inspiration from the outside.
------------------
Anyways, onto the map design:

Area layout:

        Rusty Railroad contains about 65 areas of gameplay total, 87 if counting victory areas, and the others.

        One of the themes of Rusty Railroad are "travel", which you travel to different biomes during the journey through the Railroad, via the Tunnels.
        Let's say, in a average route of the Railroad:
            8 areas are in a green, like grassland.
            Then at the end, you can choose to go up, or down.
            Both routes have 24 areas each.
            The upper 24 is based on a snowy Tundra.
            The lower 24 is based on a arid Desert.
            Then, both of the routes converage for the last 8 areas, which is based on the orange Autunm.

        Another thing that this map has are these so called "pitstops", or Station Buildings, where you can chill in them.
        And also playground areas, but I think it's best to explain them here:
------------------------------
Stations and Checkpoints:

    Stations and Checkpoints is one of the things that inspired me to make this map.
    They only appear at either the start or end of the railroad.
    Inside of that area contains enemies that you might face for the railroad (You can go around them, it's intended to be like that).
    Stations will have a "Playground" area, but Checkpoints won't.
    And, they all have a "debuff" area. But we'll talk about it later.

"Playgrounds":

    Usually, all Railroad Stations have a "Playground" area, which is where players can hang out without the fear of being destroyed by harmful enemies.
    
    So, to make sure, I used enemies that doesn't harm them at all (Ghosts, fake Pumpkins, cati, etc.). 

    The "Playground" Areas:
        I'm going to say how the "Playground" areas are designed:

            "Botanical Gardens":
                  This area has wind ghosts, and background flowers, with a different colored center (It's not a Undertale Refernce, it's unintentional).
                  It's the most simple of the "Playground Areas".

              "Frozen Ponds":
                  This area is the only area that has very low friction (low friction in the winter themed railroad will be a pain to balance).
                  The area has "Ponds".
                  The smaller ponds has a large Poison Ghost at the middle (for speed, doesn't last if you were to leave the ghost).
                  The bigger, center pond has a Barrier surrounded by standing Wind Ghosts.
                      This is intended for Cybot to gain the very powerful Barrier Scan outside of Research Lab or Cyber Castle.
                  The area also has Cati and Wind Ghosts to add with the fun of low friction.

              "Cremated Dunes":
                  This area has the second-most amount of entities.
                  The brown-like strips on the area are tried to represent the hills on dunes.
                  The darker-sand-like parts of the map, it's up to interpretation, but it acts like decor.
                  Similar to "Frozen Ponds", it has a Barrier enemy blocked off by Wind Ghosts, but at the top left corner of the area.
                  The area has a lot of standing, small cati, and a some larger, moving cati.

                "Outdoor Park":
                    This area has the most amount of entities of all of the "Playground Areas".
                    It has paths that lead to a wooden shack at the other side of the area.
                    At the middle of the map, it has a fountain.
                    Everywherwe, there're leaves and Fake Pumpkins, to try to say that this map is like a park in Autunm.
----------------------------
Enemy layout:

        Each section of a railroad follows the same format, excluding Railroad 3:

        The first 4 areas features 4 enemies, the 4th will be a "miniboss" area, where 1 enemy gets a big and small varient.
        The last 4 areas adds 2 more enemies to the roster, and have a "boss" area.
        And it repeats, 5 times in a average run.

        And I'm not going to explain any enemy reasons, play the map.
-------------------------------






"Debuff" Areas:
However, due to editor limitations, there won't be anything what I said below in the map.
    These areas are only unlocked when you had beaten this map once.
    They're important for another area at the end of the map.
    These areas are comprised of "Basements", and "Handicaps".
    They appear inside of the Stations and Checkpoints.
    When entering, the area will give you a set debuff that last as long you're in the map.
    They also have text to indicate of what debuff you gotten.
    Let's go over them:

      Basement 1:
          "The still air in the floral basement had inflated your lungs"
            Your max energy capcity has been cut in half (max energy: 150).

      Handicap 1:
          "The officers gave you a electric collar around your neck, shortening your time downed"
            Your Death Timer has been shortened by 33%.

      Basement 2N:
          "The frosted air in the icy basement had made your legs sore."
            Your max speed has been reduced by 2 [(max speed: 15), this won't affect your speed bonus from your abilities (stream, sweet tooth, night, etc.)].

      Handicap 2N:
          "Officers wearing fur coats gave you arm braces, which drains some of your energy."
          Your max regen has been reduced by 2 (max regen: 5).

      Basement 2S:
          "The heated air in the hot basement have made you thirsty".
          All abilities have a extra 1 second cooldown (whenever possible to apply).

      Handicap 2S:
          "Officers wearing shorts gave you a blindfold, now you can't know what time is it."
          You can't see the cooldown of your abilities (the gameplay indications also won't show up).

      Basement 3:
          "The scented air of the vibrant basement have made you relaxed."
          All abilities are now weaker (in any way possible).

    "So, what does debuffs are used for, when they directly hurt you?", you're saying right now.
    Well, I'll explain later.

Victory areas:
    Obvious editor limitations, you won't see this in the editor.

    Obviously, every map must have a end, and this map is no different.
    So:

      Victory area for Reckless Railroad:
        "Often times, the end of a railroad is always the start of another"
          "3 vp awarded"
          "Unlocked [Hero]" (The [Hero]'s name is meant to be interrperted).

    However, remember the debuff areas I talked about?
    Well, they're used in a different victory area, next to the general victory area, called "Destination".
    That victory area can only be entered if you have at least 1 debuff applied.
    So:
      Extra Victory area for Reckless Railroad:
        "A end to a long journey always needs a deep rest."
        "x vp awarded" (x represents the number of debuffs you have on. Theoatical max is 5, but the true max is 8).
        Depend on your debuffs you'll be awarded with other stuff, starting at 3 debuffs.
        (3 debuffs applied): "Unlocked [Hero]"
        (4 debuffs applied): "Conductor's Hat added to your accessories collection"
        (5 debuffs applied): "Conductor's Coat added to you accessories collection"

--------------------------------------
Ending:
    So, one map completed, it's very great to finish it.
    And I learned how to balance maps, and use the editor.
    I hope I can continue making maps :).

        Legacy, signing off.
