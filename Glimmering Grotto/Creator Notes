Hello!

School is a bit hard.
Basically, the thing for me is that things get very boring when there's no homework.
It's weird since people think "homework = bad", while me wants homework, as it motivates me.
And the thing is that school doesn't allow you to do alot of editor stuff.
So it resulted in me having to complete it during school hours, via downloading the Region Editor from this repository...
...and having to use WASD keys to playtest most areas. Which I'm not skilled at all...
...and also the limited time I have to do my Editor things....
...which resulted in this hodge poge of a map.

I'm not describing this map at all...
...I'm too tired and want to create another map next week.


Legacy out.
