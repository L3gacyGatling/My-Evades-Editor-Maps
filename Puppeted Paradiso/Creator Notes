Context:

Have you always have a imaginative mind that thinks of things that don't even exist, or stories that only you can understand?
Well, for me, I have a very imaginative mind of stories that only I can understand, and ideas that doesn't exist.

Like for example, this map.
One time I was taking a daily evening walk around my neighborhood, I am daydreaming, while listening to, from what I remember, Camellia.
Which said daydream is that there's a map based on Paradiso in "The Divine Comedy", but said Paradiso is controlled/puppeted by a entity (unknown at the time of the daydream), which lure angels/random beings to their doom by putting anomalies into the Paradise.
The desire to create this map ultimately overtake me, as I cancelled what I considered a not good rebalance of Overburned Oven, and started making this map.

Map layout:

This map contains a total of 84 areas (including a secret, 2 victory areas, and multiple alternate pathways that you may find)

The map is structured into 9 sections of 4 areas, called "Spheres"
Similar to "Infinite Inferno", each Sphere would reference a certain Map that currently exist in the game, which each Area in the Sphere reference each section of the map.

Sperating those Spheres are vertical transitionary areas called "Bridges"
They're seperate and unrelated to the Spheres, since their purpose is to bring you to the next Sphere (the Bridges still want you to dodge).

Anyways...


Sphere 1: Wacky Wonderland
  This section is the most average experience with Wacky Wonderland, toned down to fit the early areas.
  Sphere 1-1 contains Wavy and Zigzag.
  Sphere 1-2 contains Spiraling and Zoning.
  Sphere 1-3 contains Oscillating and Switch.
  Sphere 1-4 contains Switch and Homing.
  

Sphere 2: Shifting Sands
  This section contains enemies from Shifting Sands
  Sphere 2-1 contains Homing, Sand, and Quicksand.
  Sphere 2-2 contains Homing, Sandrock, and Quickand.
  Sphere 2-3 contains Crumbling, Sandrock, and Quicksand.
  Sphere 2-4 contains Slowing, Quicksand, and Sand.
  Cactus isn't in any of the areas, but you'll soon why.


Sphere 3: Coupled Corridors
  This section is unique, as due to the unique gimmick of 2 converging paths in the original Coupled Corridors.
  Instead of creating 2 diverging paths at the start of Sphere 3, I decided to Put only areas 1-20 for both Northern and Southern Route into 1 single Sphere.
  As since, the players will choose the Southern Route rather than the Northern Route, as it's "easier" in their eyes.
  And that areas 21-40 is just both North and South merged, and nothing special.
  So, Sphere 3-1 to 3-2 contain enemies from the Southern Route of Coupled Corridors...
  ...Zigzag, Enlarging, Mist, and Poison Sniper.
  And Sphere 3-3 to 3-4 contain enemies from the Nothern Route of Coupled Corridors...
  ...Charging, Reducing, Switch, and Lead Sniper.


Sphere 4: Quiet Quarry
  This section contains enemies from Quiet Quarry, and the usual big Wall enemies...
  Sphere 4-1 contains Slowing, with walls walking at a rabbit's pace.
  Sphere 4-2 contains Dasher and Liquid, with a single, big Wall.
  Sphere 4-3 contains Switch and Slowing, with a big Switch somewhere in this Area.
  Sphere 4-4 contains Gravity, Draining, and Slowing. No Ice sniper though.


Sphere 5: Restless Ridge
  THIS section is the only one that took the longest to create, and also a kick in the face for players that think all sections will be in the same area format.
  Due to having to:
    1. Build the layout
    2. Rebuild the layout so the Exit Zone's translate can fit into the Safe Zone of the previous area.
    3. Translate Every last Exit Zone.
    4. Add Walls and enemies
  This section made me realize that making areas similar to Restless Ridge will be very time comsuming (especially areas like Restless Ridge)
  And that while playing Restless Ridge is fun, making a similar version of Restless Ridge is not.
  Anyways:
  Sphere 5-1 contains a simple "pass through the opening", with Slippery, Normal, and Homing.
  Sphere 5-2 contains a simple "get to the end as fast as possible" with some gaps if you're not fast enough, with Freezing and Normal.
  Sphere 5-3 contains a more complicatied version of "pass through the opening" by adding another Exit Zone every 3 gaps, and you can't take too long. Also contains Turning, Immune, and Disabling.
  Sphere 5-4 contains somthing similar to Restless Ridge 39, with Immune, Gravity, and Liquid (the area is originally intended to have Repelling, but the aura is too invisible with the map background).


Sphere 6: Terrifying Temple
  This section follows the same structure as the original Terrifying Temple 
  with Sphere 6-2 to 6-3 takes you inside the "Temple".
  Sphere 6-1 contains Blind.
  Sphere 6-2 contains Ninja Star Sniper and Blind.
  Sphere 6-3 contains Summoner, which summons Blinds on contact, and Slasher.
  Sphere 6-4 contains Lotus Flower, Blind, and Ninja Star Sniper.


Sphere 7: Burning Bunker
  This section is a near copy of the layout of the original Burning Bunker.
  Though the darkness is made to be not dark enough that since I have to provide a lantern if it's too dark.
  Sphere 7-1 is a harder version of one of the obsticle courses in Burning Bunker 23-22.
  Sphere 7-2 contains Homing, Slowing, and Fire Trail.
  Sphere 7-3 contains Dasher, Enlarging, and Fire Trail.
  Sphere 7-4 contains Draining, Sizing, and Fire Trail.


Sphere 8: Frozen Fijord
  Sphere 8-1 are multiple Frost Giants arranged to make a bullet hell pattern.
  Sphere 8-2 takes you into the caves, which you find Icicle, Slippery, and Snowman.
  Sphere 8-3 contains Ice Sniper, Icicle, and Snowman.
  Sphere 8-4 takes you out of the caves, and see walls in symmetry. Contains Snowman, Icicle, and Frost Giant.

Sphere 9: Ancient Abyss
  Sphere 9-1 contains Void Crawler, Void Swarm, and Normal.
  Sphere 9-2 contains Void Sniper, and Void Crawler.
  Sphere 9-3 contains Dripping, Void Crawler, and Normal.
  Sphere 9-4 contains Void Drain, Dripping, Void Swarm, Void Sniper, Void Crawler, and Normal.

Victory Area (Normal Path):

  "You gaze up into the skies where invisible strings from Empyrean pulled the Spheres"
  "4 vp awarded"




Anyways, that's all of the areas for the "Normal" path.
There's more stuff hiding in the Spheres
If you want to know more about them (and already know about them), go to Line 150.
