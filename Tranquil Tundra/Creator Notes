Story:

    Real Life Context:
        I.... hate Spring and Summer.
        Yes, the time of the year where the weather is hot, and you can go outside and hang out in shorts, and have fun in the beach.
        I like everything about those, but the thing that I hate the most is the SUN.
        The SUN is really hot and unbearable for me, and I have to put on sunscreen everyday, just to go outside and have fun (not fun to wash it off during shower)
        Especially when Marching Band season starts, which I have to be in the Sun for 3 hours at 6 pm.
        Pretty much, everybody in this school that I am friends of like summer the most, except me.

    Editor Context:
        This map was originally meant to be a ENCORE, or alternate version of Overnburned Oven.
        However, I don't know how to make a setup to lead to the ENCORE, so I "scrapped" it (also this map used to be called "Fevent Freezer").
        However, I didn't scrapped the concept of a "cold" map, so it became this map.
        Also, near the end of this map, I thought a bit and think this is the oppisite, or ENCORE of Grand Garden (sorry for the ULTRAKILL stuff).

Map Design:

    This map is 28 areas long, and uses Wind Sniper in a normal Area
    The map uses enemies associated with the cold, or colors that represents Winter (Dasher, Icicle, Wind Sniper, Snowman, Phantom, and Frost Giant)

    Layout:
        Areas 1-7 features Dashers and Icicles, both horizontal and vertical.
        Areas 8-14 have Wind snipers and Snowman, which Icicle comes in Area 11.
        Areas 15-21 have Phantoms by itself, then joined with Icicles
        Areas 22-28 uses all enemies stated above, but sometimes, one of them sits out, to not make it just "Grand Garden".
        Ice Giants arrive at Area 25, in random patterns.
        And Area 28 is taller than usual, as it's harder to balance this area in a small space.

Victory Area:


        
        "The quiet, soft winds sing you to sleep."
        "3 VP awarded"
        
        "Snow Goggles added to your accessory collection"

    

Ending:
    This map is very simple, as unlike others, it doesn't have to require me to measure the x-y coords too much (Oven Classic)
    And not overstressing the enemy variation (Railroad Classic).
    Eh, I hope you have a good time playing this map.


Legacy Out.
