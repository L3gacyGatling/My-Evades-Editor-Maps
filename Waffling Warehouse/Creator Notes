Context:

    Have you ever seen a warehouse before?
    Well, I pretty much did, sort of, and it's Costco.
    Which if you didn't know, is both a store and a warehouse.
    It took me until I was 14 to find out Costco is store in a warehouse via. Youtube video.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Also, the word "Waffling" doesn't correlates to waffles as in food (it'll be funny if there's a irl warehouse stores dried waffles though)
    "Waffling" means (in Northern American terms):
        "Fail to make up one's mind"
    I just found this word while trying to find obscure words in Dictionary.com to use to name this map.
Map Layout:

    This map consists of 36 areas (a very unique one). Which each section is 9 areas.
    The floor almost matches the color of concrete, which I usually envisioned what a usual warehouse be (using my experience with Costco).
    The map introduces certain enemies that're usually in maps that you don't find them in a normal map:
    Excluding the normal enemy, these include(in the order they're inroduced):
        Penny (initially from Wacky Wonderland Hard)
        Radar (initially from Cyber Castle, yes, I count it as not a normal map)
        Confectioner (also initially from Wacky Wonderland Hard)
        And Prediction Sniper (initially from Cyber Castle Hard)

      Funny enough, the order the enemies are introduces alternates between "Wares" and "Security"
        Wares being Penny and Confectioner.
        Security being Radar and Prediction Sniper.

Victory Area:

    Quote:
      "You quickly left the warehouse without deciding what to take."
      "3 vp awarded"

Ending:

    Well, this is a very short piece of notes.
    
    But at least I finished this map!

    And also I'll say thanks to Joni for playtesting this map.
