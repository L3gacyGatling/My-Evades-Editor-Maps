Hello, this is the Creator Notes for Waffling Warehouse

By: Legacy Gatling.


Context:

    Have you ever seen a warehouse before?
    Well, I pretty much did, sort of, and it's Costco.
    Which if you didn't know, is both a store and a warehouse.
    It took me until I was 14 to find out Costco is store in a warehouse via. Youtube video.

Map Layout:

    This map consists of 36 areas (a very unique one). Which each section is 9 areas.
    The floor almost matches the color of concrete, which I usually envisioned what a usual warehouse be (using my experience with Costco).
    The map introduces certain enemies that're usually in maps that you don't find them in a normal map:
    Excluding the normal enemy, these include(in the order they're inroduced):
        Penny (initially from Wacky Wonderland Hard)
        Radar (initially from Cyber Castle, yes, I count it as not a normal map)
        Confectioner (also initially from Wacky Wonderland Hard)
        And Prediction Sniper (initially from Cyber Castle Hard)
  This is indeed very simple to make (the next simple is Tranquil Tundra, third is Overburned Oven).

Victory Area:

    Quote:
      "Nothing in this warehouse had conviced you to steal, so you left."
      "3 vp awarded"

Ending:

    Well, this is a very short piece of notes.
    But at least I finished this!

Legacy out.
