PLEASE NOTE:

IT"S HIGHLY RECOMMANDED TO USE Sonic.exe's UNOFFICIAL REGION EDITOR WHEN PLAYING MY MAPS, DESPITE OF THE QOL FEATURES THAT PIFARY'S SANDBOX HAVE.

THOUGH, IF YOU'RE USING PIFARY's SANDBOX DEPITE WHAT I SAID, PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE'LL BE SERVERAL, OR MANY FEATURES THAT'RE BROKEN IN THOSE MAPS WHEN USING SANDBOX.

SUCH AS:

CERTAIN TILE TEXTURES MISSING

CERTAIN ENEMIES UNIMPLEMENTED (INDICATED BY A FUNCTIONLESS, PURPLE ENEMY IN A AREA REPLACING THE UNIMPLEMENTED ONE) INTO THE SANDBOX

CERTAIN BUGS THAT MIGHT BREAK CERTAIN AREAS OF THE MAP

COLORLESS TITLE STROKE COLOR

NO FRICTION PROPERTY (THOUGH THAT ONE ISN"T INCLUDED IN ANY OF MY MAPS)

AND MUCH MORE.
---------------------
BUT, PLEASE DO NOT HARRESS THE CREATOR OF THE SANDBOX INTO FIXING THESE THINGS.
THE SANDBOX IS STILL UPDATING WITH CERTAIN FEATURES AND BUG FIXES
IF YOU FIND A BUG IN SANDBOX, JUST REPORT THEM INTO THE REPOSITORY OF PIFARY'S SANDBOX.
THANK YOU FOR READING THIS
